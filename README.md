Sublime Text PHP Snippets

The idea behind this repository is that we end up with a set of useful php snippets for 
quickly doing the day to day tasks. keywords should be as small as possible while remaining
memorable. 

A list of keywords, descriptions and usage will appear here very (very) soon, along with the code
to keep them up to date. If you have any snippets you think should be included then please submit them via
pull request.
